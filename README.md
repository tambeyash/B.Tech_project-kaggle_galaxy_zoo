# Galaxy Morphology Classification with Machine Learning

This project was done as a final project for my engineering degree.

It involves a dataset obtained from Kaggle to train a model that can classify galaxy images based on their shape. The classification was done according to the hubble classification scheme.

The dataset was obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge)

 The project utilizes the Keras deep learning library and implements the VGG16 neural network architecture.
